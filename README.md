# KeepItGoing---Mobile
An improved version of my Ludum Dare 46 submission Keep It Going. On google play store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PatAle.KeepItGoing

This is a Unity project, so the folder can be opened in Unity or Unity Hub.

It also uses Google Play Services, so players can submit high scores and gain achievements.
